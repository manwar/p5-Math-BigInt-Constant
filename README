Math::BigInt::Constant - arbitrarily big integer constants

(C) ..--- ----- ----- .--- - ..--- by - . .-.. ... .-.-.-  All rights reserved.

Requires new version of Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat as found on CPAN.

This package allows you to store constant Math::BigInts like this:

	use Math::BigInt::Constant;

	my $x = Math::BigInt::Constant->new(2);

	print "$x\n";			# okay, prints 2
	print $x+2,"\n";		# okay, prints 4
	print $x++,"\n";		# not okay, would modify $x

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
